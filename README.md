# Blackjack

Blackjack is a classic casino game of chance and strategy. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, partly due to the fact that it's an easy game to learn and build strategies upon. Whilst usually considered a game of luck, statistics play a massive role in the game as well, and mathematicians and intellectuals from all over the world are fascinated by the idea of making money through pure stats.
