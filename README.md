# Blackjack

Blackjack is a classic casino game of chance and strategy. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, partly due to the fact that it's an easy game to learn and build strategies upon. Whilst considered a game of luck, statistics play a massive role in the game as well, and mathematicians and intellectuals from all over the world are fascinated by the idea of making money through pure stats.

# Design

## Color Palette
For the color scheme I chose these four colors that go with the cards displayed as well. The green color in the background is meant to mimic the tables in casinos, giving it an authentic feel to the game.

## Typography

For the font I went with a simple Kanit font that stands out and it's elegant.

## Wireframes

This initial design was made using Balsamiq. The mobile design is aiming to contain everything without scrolling down or with minimal scrolling, and the same idea is kept in mind while designing the desktop version.
